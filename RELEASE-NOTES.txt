First release as a public repository



March 28:

The first release relied on a small number of popular 3rd party packages such as
cowboy, ranch, erlcloud, and mochiweb.  In each case we relied on the latest
stable version.

Several users reported problems integrating cx_runtime in to larger on-going projects
that relied on one or more of the same 3rd party packages because they were using
a different version of the library.

In some cases we had created a dependency on a 3rd party package that provided
significant functionality even though we might only draw on a handful of functions
from that package.


The primary goal of this release is to dramatically reduce the number of dependencies
by a focus on the core functionality that we actually needed.
